# **The Great Hashrate Migration: An Evidentiary Analysis of National Dominance in Bitcoin Mining and the Rise of US Centralization**



This report provides a definitive, evidence-based answer to the query of whether any single country has demonstrated dominance in cryptocurrency mining. The analysis reveals an unequivocal "yes," but this dominance is not static. The evidence presents a clear, two-act narrative detailing a seismic shift in global power over the last five years.

**Act I (Pre-2021): The Era of Chinese Hegemony.** The first era was defined by China's absolute and uncontested dominance. Bolstered by structural advantages in cheap energy and hardware manufacturing, China at its peak controlled between 60% and 75.5% of the global Bitcoin hashrate.1 This centralized the network's security within a single authoritarian state, posing a "shutdown risk" that was ultimately and abruptly realized in 2021\.3

**Act II (2022-2025): The Rise of American Dominance.** China's 2021 state-level ban on all crypto activities triggered a "Great Mining Migration" 4, an event that permanently restructured the industry's geopolitical landscape. The United States emerged as the undisputed primary beneficiary of this exodus.5 By 2025, evidence from the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance (CCAF) confirms this new reality: the US accounts for 75.4% of *reported* global mining activity.7 This new dominance is distinct from China's; it is corporate, institutional, and transparent.

**The New Centralization and Evolved Risk.** American dominance has not eliminated centralization risk but has transformed it. The new concentration is twofold: at the *corporate* level (with a handful of publicly-traded US firms controlling vast hashrate) and, more critically, at the *pool* level. By late 2025, two mining pools—the US-based Foundry USA and the China-affiliated AntPool—collectively control over 51% of the global hashrate, raising concerns not seen since 2014\.9

This concentration, combined with the fact that the dominant pool (Foundry USA) is a US-based, KYC/AML-compliant entity 11, has shifted the primary existential threat. The risk is no longer a "shutdown risk" (as in China) but a "censorship risk." The concentration of hashrate in a single, highly-regulated jurisdiction exposes the network to state-level transaction censorship via agencies like the US Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).12 The evidence shows a clear transition of dominance from China to the United States. In doing so, the fundamental risk to the Bitcoin network has evolved from that of state-intolerance to that of state-capture and co-option.

## **Part I: The First Era: China's Preeminence and the 2021 Exodus**

### **1.1 China's Uncontested Hegemony (2019-2021)**

For nearly a decade, the narrative of Bitcoin mining was synonymous with China. The evidence of this dominance is comprehensive and quantitative. Data from the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance (CCAF), the premier academic institution tracking mining geography, showed that in September 2019, mainland China's share of the total global Bitcoin hashrate was a staggering **75.5%**.2 Other contemporary reports confirm this supermajority, citing figures of "over 60%".1 During this same period, China's closest rival, the United States, accounted for a mere **4.1%** of the global hashrate, underscoring the lack of any significant competition.2

This dominance was not accidental but was built upon a unique convergence of powerful structural advantages:

1. **Cheap and Abundant Energy:** The primary input for Bitcoin mining is electricity, and China offered it at globally competitive prices. Miners gained access to an "overbuilt hydroelectricity infrastructure" 1, particularly in southern provinces like Sichuan and Yunnan. This access was most pronounced during the annual "rainy season," typically from May to October, which provided a massive surplus of low-cost hydropower.15  
2. **Hardware Proximity:** Nearly all competitive Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) manufacturers—the specialized computers essential for mining—were based in China, most notably Bitmain.16 This co-location gave Chinese miners preferential, faster, and cheaper access to the latest, most efficient hardware, allowing them to out-compete foreign operators continuously.  
3. **Regulatory Arbitrage:** In the network's early-to-mid cycle, Chinese authorities largely "overlooked the sector".1 While Bitcoin *trading* and Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) were clamped down upon to prevent capital flight, mining was viewed as a "lucrative business model" that helped the nation attract significant volumes of foreign capital.1

A unique feature of this era, empirically recorded by CCAF, was the "seasonal hashrate migration".17 This was a massive, twice-yearly logistical undertaking where miners would physically move their operations. In the summer, they flocked to Sichuan to capitalize on the "rainy season's" abundant, low-cost hydropower.15 In the dry winter months, they would migrate back to northern regions like Xinjiang, which offered stable, albeit less environmentally friendly, coal-fired power.17

This seasonal migration demonstrates the sheer scale of China's dominance. The security of the entire global Bitcoin network, designed to be decentralized, was for years directly correlated with the seasonal rainfall patterns and provincial energy policies of the People's Republic of China. This represented a profound geophysical centralization long before the political risks became acute.

This arrangement, however, was built on a fragile and unsustainable internal contradiction. The Chinese state simultaneously promoted mining as an industrial activity to attract foreign capital while vehemently opposing Bitcoin as a monetary tool that enabled capital flight, a direct threat to its strict monetary controls.1 This fragile equilibrium was destined to break.

### **1.2 The State Crackdown (2021): Drivers and Consequences**

The unstable equilibrium collapsed in 2021\. The Chinese government, which had tolerated mining for years, reversed its position with swift and decisive finality.

The timeline of the ban was rapid and comprehensive:

* **May 2021:** The Financial Stability and Development Committee of the State Council, a high-level government body, signaled a forthcoming "crack down on bitcoin mining and trading".2  
* **June 2021:** Authorities moved from signals to action, ordering crackdowns in key mining provinces and instructing banks and non-bank payment platforms (like Alipay) to cease providing any services for cryptocurrency-related activities.2  
* **September 2021:** The state issued a blanket ban, declaring all cryptocurrency activities, including mining and transactions, illegal.4

The official rationale cited concerns over "financial crime and... economic instability".3 However, the data points to deeper political and monetary drivers.

First and foremost was the prevention of **capital flight**. Chainalysis, a blockchain data platform, estimated that over $50 billion worth of cryptocurrency left East Asian accounts (believed to be predominantly from China) between 2019 and 2020 alone.3 Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies represented a significant breach in China's "strict capital controls".3

Second, this crackdown was not happening in a vacuum. It was a core component of President Xi Jinping's "common prosperity" campaign.3 This broad, state-interventionist policy aims to curb capital flight and redistribute wealth. Such a goal is "far more difficult to accomplish" if the wealthy can "circumvent... capital controls through offshore cryptocurrency exchanges".3

Third, the ban on private, decentralized cryptocurrencies directly coincided with China's ambitious state-controlled alternative: the digital yuan (CBDC).19 The 2021 crackdown was not merely an anti-crypto move; it was a *sovereign monetary policy* action. The state was eliminating a direct, permissionless competitor to clear the market for its own centralized, surveilled digital currency.

The immediate consequence was a "hash rate collapse".20 The network's total computational power fell drastically. This triggered the largest *downward* mining difficulty adjustment in Bitcoin's history in July 2021, a drop of nearly 28%.21 This event marked the beginning of the "Great Mining Migration".4

In a profound historical irony, China's authoritarian attempt to cripple the network had the paradoxical effect of dramatically strengthening it. The ban, by forcing the hashrate to scatter globally, inadvertently solved the network's single greatest centralization risk: the "China controls Bitcoin" narrative.16 This massive, real-world stress test proved the network's resilience. By shutting down or limiting mining operations, China "effectively distributed mining power to other regions across the globe," making the entire network "much more robust".20

### **1.3 The "Great Mining Migration"**

The 2021 ban acted as the catalyst for a permanent and historic restructuring of the global mining industry. CCAF's data, however, reveals a crucial detail: the "Great Mining Migration" had already begun *before* the ban was official.

The hashrate in mainland China was already in significant decline, dropping from **75.5%** in September 2019 to **46%** by April 2021\.2 This "proactive exodus" indicates that sophisticated, well-capitalized, and politically astute mining operations read the "signals" 16 and began relocating their capital and hardware *months* in advance. These were not panicked refugees; they were professional operators executing a planned, large-scale capital relocation. This fact set the stage for the new mining hubs, particularly in the US, to be institutional and corporate from their inception.

This migrating hashrate flowed to jurisdictions with two key characteristics: cheap, abundant energy (often fossil fuels) and perceived regulatory stability.5 The CCAF data meticulously maps this exodus:

* **The United States:** Emerged as the clear destination of choice, growing from **4.1%** (Sep 2019\) to **16.8%** (Apr 2021).2  
* **Kazakhstan:** Its proximity to China and cheap, coal-powered energy made it an initial favorite. Its share exploded from **1.4%** (Sep 2019\) to **8.2%** (Apr 2021\) 2, eventually peaking at **18.1%** by August 2021\.4  
* **Russia:** Also saw significant growth, increasing from **5.9%** (Sep 2019\) to **6.8%** (Apr 2021\) 2, and reaching **11.2%** by August 2021\.4

The table below provides a clear, at-a-glance visualization of this historic migration, charting the decline of the old hegemon and the rise of the new.

| Table 1: Global Hashrate Distribution by Country (Sep 2019 – Aug 2021\) |  |  |  |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Country** | **Share (Sep 2019\)** | **Share (Apr 2021 \- *pre-ban*)** | **Share (Aug 2021 \- *post-ban*)** |
| China | 75.5% | 46.0% | 0.0% (officially) |
| United States | 4.1% | 16.8% | 35.4% |
| Kazakhstan | 1.4% | 8.2% | 18.1% |
| Russia | 5.9% | 6.8% | 11.2% |
| Data compiled from.2 *Note: The Aug 2021 data reflects the immediate post-ban landscape. The 0.0% for China reflects the official ban; underground mining persists.* |  |  |  |

This migration set the stage for the second era of Bitcoin mining, one defined not by China, but by the rapid and profound ascendancy of the United States.

## **Part II: The Second Era: The Ascendancy of American Mining (2022-2025)**

### **2.1 Quantifying US Dominance: A CCAF Deep Dive**

In the years following the "Great Migration," the United States solidified its position as the new, undisputed center of the global mining industry. This new dominance is not mere speculation; it is confirmed by rigorous academic and governmental data.

The most definitive evidence comes from the **2025 'Cambridge Digital Mining Industry Report'**.7 Recognizing the limitations of old tracking methods, CCAF employed a new, direct-survey methodology, drawing on "direct practitioner insights rather than abstractions".8 This comprehensive survey involved 49 digital mining firms (41% of which are publicly listed) with operations spanning 23 countries.7

The scale of this study is remarkable: it successfully captured data representing **48% of the total global Bitcoin hashrate**.7 The findings from this massive, representative sample are unambiguous:

**Of this 48% sample of the global network, the United States accounts for 75.4% of total *reported* Bitcoin mining activity**.7

Canada, the next-closest nation, accounts for a distant 7.1%.7

This figure must be understood in context. The 75.4% is the US share of the *formal, corporate, and auditable* mining industry. The CCAF's survey participants include the largest publicly-listed North American miners, such as Bitfarms, CleanSpark, Hut 8, IREN, MARA, and Riot.8 Therefore, this data proves definitively that the *institutional layer* of the Bitcoin network, the one most visible to and relevant for regulators and large investors, is now overwhelmingly American.

This rapid expansion is corroborated by the US government. The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) launched its own emergency survey in early 2024 to track this "very rapid" growth.25 The EIA's preliminary estimates suggest that US cryptocurrency mining consumes between **0.6% and 2.3% of total U.S. electricity consumption** 25—a massive footprint largely attributed to the relocation of miners from China.25

### **2.2 The American Mining Landscape: Corporate and Concentrated**

The nature of this new American dominance is fundamentally different from the Chinese era. While Chinese dominance was characterized by a scattered, opaque, and often anonymous collection of miners, US dominance is corporate, institutional, and publicly-traded.

This new landscape is defined by large, publicly-traded corporations with access to US capital markets 27 and support from favorable *state-level* policies, particularly in energy-rich states like Texas, Georgia, and Kentucky.5

Reports from mid-2025 identify the largest publicly traded Bitcoin miners by their operational scale. These are almost exclusively North American firms. The corporate nature of US dominance is not abstract; it can be quantified by listing the public companies that constitute it.

| Table 2: Top US-Based Public Mining Companies by Hashrate (Q3 2025\) |  |  |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Company** | **Market Cap (USD)** | **Operational/Deployed Hashrate (EH/s)** |
| Marathon Digital Holdings | \> $6.2 Billion | \> 58.0 EH/s |
| CleanSpark | \~$3.56 Billion | \> 50.0 EH/s |
| Riot Platforms | \~$2.80 Billion | \> 33.0 EH/s |
| American Bitcoin Corp (Hut 8\) | \--- | \~25.0 EH/s |
| Core Scientific | \~$0.86 Billion | \> 19.0 EH/s |
| Data compiled from.28 *Note: Hashrates are approximate deployed/operational capacities as of mid-2025.* |  |  |

This corporate structure has profound implications. These are not anonymous actors in Sichuan; they are SEC-reporting entities.29 They are legible to the US government and accountable to shareholders. Their primary fiduciary duty is to those shareholders, which compels them to prioritize legal and regulatory compliance above all else. This very structure provides a direct, built-in vector for government influence and regulatory capture that simply did not exist during the Chinese era.

### **2.3 The Counter-Narrative: Reconciling Conflicting Data (The "Ghost" Hashrate)**

A critical analysis requires addressing a significant conflict in the available data. While the 2025 CCAF *survey* shows 75.4% US dominance of the *reported* network 7, other reports, citing data from platforms like CryptoQuant, claim that China-based *mining pools* still control **55%** of the global network as of late 2024\.31

These two data points appear mutually exclusive, but they are not. They are measuring two different things, and their discrepancy reveals a crucial truth about the network's new structure.

1. CCAF's 75.4% 7: This is a "bottom-up" survey of the **physical location** of *known, formal, corporate miners*.7 It measures where the *hardware* is.  
2. CryptoQuant's 55% 32: This is a "top-down" analysis of **pool affiliation**. It measures where the *hashrate is pointed*. A pool's "nationality" (e.g., classifying AntPool as "Chinese") is distinct from the physical location of all its miners.32

The 55% figure is explained by the persistence of the "ghost" hashrate. Despite the 2021 ban, studies confirm that "underground" mining persists in China, with estimates ranging from 15-20% of the global total.31 These underground miners circumvent the ban by using **VPNs and proxy services** 31 to hide their true geolocations and connect to international mining pools.31 This renders the CCAF's *original* geolocational IP-tracking model (which produced the 2019-2021 maps) 17 obsolete, a fact which prompted their new survey-based methodology for 2025\.

The true picture is a synthesis of both data sets:

* The **United States** almost certainly controls the vast *institutional and corporate majority* of the physical hashrate (as the CCAF survey of known firms shows).7  
* **China-affiliated pools** (like AntPool and F2Pool) likely control a majority of the *global retail and underground* hashrate, which consists of underground Chinese miners *plus* the large contingent of smaller, retail miners across Asia who have historically used those pools.32

As one analysis notes, the "global nature \[of mining pools\] complicates assessing true geographical hashrate distribution".33 The key takeaway from this data conflict is *not* to equate pool nationality with miner nationality. A US miner can point their hashrate to a Chinese pool, and an underground Chinese miner can point their hashrate to a US pool. This very ambiguity proves that the *mining pool* has become the new nexus of power and the most critical unit of analysis, a fact that leads directly to the new, evolved form of network centralization.

## **Part III: The New Centralization: From Geopolitics to Pool Politics**

### **3.1 Foundry USA and the Concentration of Pool-Level Power**

The ascendance of the United States as the dominant mining nation has been accompanied by an equally significant, and perhaps more concerning, concentration of power at the *mining pool* level.

A mining pool is a cooperative that allows miners to combine, or "pool," their computational resources to increase the probability of finding a block and earning a reward. The pool operator, in exchange for a fee, manages the infrastructure and distributes the rewards. This architecture, however, centralizes significant power in the hands of the pool operator.

In the wake of the "Great Migration," a US-based entity has risen to an unprecedented position of dominance.

* By late 2024, the **US-based Foundry USA** pool, which is part of the Digital Currency Group, became the largest mining pool in the world, controlling a commanding **36.5%** of the network's total hashrate.33 Its growth was described as "exponential," far outpacing its historic rivals like the China-affiliated AntPool.35  
* This concentration has since evolved into a duopoly. By August 2025, **Foundry USA and AntPool** (which is affiliated with Chinese hardware giant Bitmain) 36 collectively control **over 51%** 9 to **56%** 10 of the global Bitcoin hashrate.

This is the first time a "51% attack" has become a *theoretical* possibility by the collusion of just two entities since the GHash.io incident in 2014\.9 While analysts correctly note that a malicious attack (like a double-spend) is economically irrational and "economically pointless" 9, as the pools would be destroying the value of their own investments, this argument misses the real, modern threat.

The true risk is not a malicious *attack* but *compliant censorship*.10 The network's control is now consolidated into two entities that are, *de facto*, agents of influence for the world's two largest, competing geopolitical powers. One is a US-based, SOC-compliant, KYC-enforcing entity.11 The other is affiliated with a Chinese hardware monopoly.35 This transforms Bitcoin's security model into a geopolitical chessboard, where the most potent threat is not a rogue actor, but a state-compliant one.

| Table 3: Bitcoin Mining Pool Hashrate Distribution (Q3 2025\) |  |  |  |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Mining Pool** | **HQ Affiliation** | **Hashrate Share (%)** | **Cumulative Share (%)** |
| Foundry USA | United States | \~30.5% \- 36.5% | 30.5% \- 36.5% |
| AntPool | China | \~16.4% \- 18.2% | 46.9% \- 54.7% |

| Data compiled from.9 *Note: Shares are estimates from mid-to-late 2025 and fluctuate daily. Foundry and AntPool's combined share has consistently fluctuated above 51%.* |  |  |  |

### **3.2 The Political Economy of American Dominance (2025)**

The new US dominance is reinforced by a dramatic, if contradictory, shift in US federal policy under the 2025 Trump administration. This administration has engineered the most significant pro-Bitcoin transformation in US history, but one that strategically benefits Wall Street over domestic miners.

Key pro-Bitcoin policy actions in 2025 include:

1. **Executive Order (Jan 23, 2025):** The "Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology" executive order is a landmark document. It explicitly states it is the policy of the administration to support "responsible growth" of digital assets and *prohibits* the development of a US Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC).40 Crucially, it protects the right of citizens to "access and use... open public blockchain networks," including the explicit "ability to... **participate in mining and validating**".40  
2. **Strategic Bitcoin Reserve:** On March 6, 2025, the administration signed a policy pledging that the government would *never sell* its approximately 207,000 in seized BTC (worth over $17 billion), establishing a *de facto* strategic reserve.41  
3. **ETF "Floodgates":** The administration's new, friendly SEC leadership, led by Paul Atkins, reversed regulatory hostility and "opened the floodgates" for crypto Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs).41 By October 2025, this led to an explosion in institutional adoption, with $1.4 Trillion in cumulative Spot Bitcoin ETF volumes.41

This aggressive support for Bitcoin as a *financial asset*—driving its price to all-time highs of over $126,000 in October 2025 41—masks a striking contradiction, aptly summarized as **"Wall Street Wins, US Miners Still Waiting"**.41

Despite the "MADE IN THE USA" rhetoric 41, the administration provided **"virtually no direct support"** for the domestic *mining industry* itself.41

While Wall Street celebrated record ETF inflows, US miners faced a brutal "post-halving revenue collapse".41 The April 2024 halving cut block rewards in half, and with rising network difficulty, the median cost to mine one Bitcoin crossed $70,000 in Q2 2025\.41 In the face of this economic crisis, US miners received:

* **No meaningful federal subsidies.**  
* **No tax advantages.**  
* **No infrastructure support**.41

This stands in stark contrast to the $52.7 billion in federal subsidies the administration continued to provide for semiconductor manufacturing under the CHIPS Act.41 The policy reveals a clear *financialization* strategy, not an *industrial* one. The administration has embraced Bitcoin-as-an-asset (an easy political win that boosts Wall Street and reinforces the dollar system) 40 while shunning Bitcoin-as-an-industry (which is energy-intensive, politically messy, and creates local externalities like noise pollution).25

This policy is geopolitically short-sighted. By letting the domestic mining industry struggle, the administration risks bankrupting the very firms that provide its hard-won hashrate dominance. This could, in turn, lead to a *new* migration, as bankrupt US miners are forced to sell their hardware at auction, which will inevitably flow to new jurisdictions with cheaper energy (like South America or the Middle East) 8, thus ceding US dominance.

### **3.3 The Censorship Vector: OFAC and the Risk of Regulatory Capture**

This section details the primary risk of American dominance: state-level transaction censorship. The concentration of the *formal* hashrate (75.4%) 7 and the single largest *pool* (Foundry, 36.5%) 33 within the United States creates a potent and critical point of failure.

The vector for this censorship is the **U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)**. OFAC maintains a list of sanctioned entities and individuals, which includes specific Bitcoin addresses.12 It is illegal under US law for any US person or entity to transact with these addresses.

Foundry USA, as a US-based company that advertises its SOC compliance and its "KYC/AML of Pool Members" 11, is *legally obligated* to comply with these sanctions.

This threat is not theoretical. As of early 2025, **F2Pool** (a China-affiliated pool) was already observed to be **censoring OFAC-sanctioned transactions** 12, presumably out of caution. The mechanism of censorship has two phases:

1. **Phase 1 (Transaction Delay):** When a *minority* of pools (like F2Pool) censors, the impact is minimal. The sanctioned transaction is simply ignored by that pool and remains in the mempool until a non-censoring pool mines it in a subsequent block. This results only in a minor *delay*.12  
2. **Phase 2 (Existential Risk):** The true, existential risk arises if a *majority* of the hashrate (e.g., a compliant Foundry USA, potentially in concert with a cautious AntPool) 10 not only *censors* the transactions but also **refuses to build on top of blocks from other miners that *do* include those transactions**.12 This is known as an "orphaning" attack. If this were to happen, those transactions would be permanently barred from the blockchain for as long as the censoring majority holds. In this scenario, **"Bitcoin would no longer be censorship-resistant"**.12

The dominance of US-based, regulated mining has thus given the US government a *de facto* "censorship switch" over the Bitcoin network.10 The 2014 GHash.io risk was about a *rogue operator* potentially attacking the network.9 The 2025 Foundry risk is about a *compliant operator* following the law. This is a far more insidious threat, as the pool would be "correctly" adhering to its jurisdiction's regulations while simultaneously destroying the network's core global value proposition of permissionless, neutral transactions.

### **3.4 Stratum V2: The Technical Defense Against Centralization**

In response to this clear and present danger of pool-level centralization and censorship, a technical solution has been developed and promoted: **Stratum V2**.

The legacy protocol, **Stratum V1**, is the technical enabler of this censorship vector. In the V1 architecture, the *pool operator* does all the "thinking." The pool selects all transactions from the mempool, assembles them into a "block template," and sends this template to its miners. The individual miners merely provide "dumb" computational power to hash the template the pool gave them.10 This centralizes the critical power of transaction-selection entirely in the hands of the pool operator.

**Stratum V2** is a new-generation protocol designed to fix this. Its most important feature is **"Job Negotiation"**.10 This feature *returns power to the individual miners*. It allows *them* to select their own transactions and construct their own block templates, which they then submit to the pool.36

If Stratum V2 were widely adopted, a pool like Foundry USA *could not* unilaterally censor an OFAC-sanctioned transaction. The thousands of individual miners connected to its pool would be free to include any (valid) transactions they wish, severing the pool's centralized censorship vector.37

Despite this, Stratum V2 adoption is "slowly beginning" 44, and the vast majority of the network's hashrate still uses the vulnerable V1 protocol.37 The hurdles are significant:

* It faces a "chicken-and-egg scenario" where miners and pools are hesitant to be the first to switch.45  
* It requires miners to install new, V2-compatible firmware on their ASICs, which can be a slow and complex process.46  
* It has a steeper "learning curve" for operators.45

Most critically, the incentives are misaligned. Why would dominant pools *voluntarily* choose to give up their power?37 For them, the primary benefits of V2 are *efficiency* (it uses a more efficient binary data format) and *security* (it's encrypted, protecting against "hash-rate-hijacking" attacks).37 Decentralization is a feature for the *network*, not necessarily a profit-driver for the *pool*.

This has created a systemic gridlock. The network's primary technical defense against centralization is being slow-rolled by the very entities it is designed to disempower.

## **Part IV: Conclusive Analysis: The State of Network Dominance in 2025**

### **4.1 From "China Controls Bitcoin" to "America Censors Bitcoin": A Synthesis**

The evidence presented in this report confirms that the Bitcoin network has experienced two distinct eras of national dominance.

**Act 1 (China, Pre-2021)** was a dominance of *production* (hardware) and *energy* (hydro/coal). The primary risk was a **state shutdown**—a blunt, physical threat that was ultimately realized in 2021, forcing the network to adapt.4

**Act 2 (United States, 2022-2025)** is a dominance of *capital* (publicly traded firms like Marathon and Riot) 29 and *control* (pool-level concentration in Foundry USA).9 The primary risk is not a shutdown—US policy is, for now, vocally supportive 40—but one of **regulatory capture and censorship**.12

The Bitcoin network has successfully traded a clear, physical *shutdown risk* for a far more nuanced, political *censorship risk*. For a network whose entire *raison d'être* is to be a permissionless, censorship-resistant, and neutral monetary system, the new US-based dominance poses a more fundamental and existential threat to its core principles than the Chinese era ever did.

### **4.2 Strategic Outlook and Future Scenarios**

The analysis of the current 2025 landscape points to three potential future scenarios for network dominance and health.

Scenario 1: The "Compliant" Network (Status Quo)  
In this scenario, US corporate 7 and pool 9 dominance persists. The "Wall Street Wins, Miners Wait" policy 41 continues, but US miners survive by leveraging state-level advantages.5 Critically, Stratum V2 adoption remains slow 37 due to the misaligned incentives of the dominant pools. OFAC-compliant censorship 12 becomes normalized at the pool level. This would create a de facto "clean" (US-compliant) and "grey" (non-compliant) ecosystem, bifurcating the network and fundamentally threatening Bitcoin's core property of fungibility.  
Scenario 2: The "Resilient" Network (Forced Decentralization)  
This scenario begins with a major censorship event. For example, Foundry USA, complying with a new OFAC directive, not only censors transactions but also orphans a block from a smaller, non-compliant pool.12 This overt act of censorship creates a market panic and proves the "economic irrationality" argument wrong. In response, rational, profit-seeking miners flee Foundry en masse—not for ideological reasons, but because their revenue is now at risk.37 They flock to smaller, non-censoring pools that actively promote their Stratum V2-compliance.37 This market-driven exodus forces V2 adoption across the network, re-decentralizes power away from the duopoly, and technically solves the censorship vector.  
Scenario 3: The "Migrating" Network (Economic Exodus)  
In this scenario, the "Wall Street Wins, Miners Wait" policy 41 proves fatal. The brutal post-halving economics, combined with a lack of federal support, pushes dozens of US-based corporate miners 29 into bankruptcy. Their highly-efficient hardware is sold at auction to international buyers. This capital migrates to new jurisdictions with cheaper energy and lower political risk (e.g., South America, the Middle East, or Africa).8 The US loses its hashrate dominance, and the cycle of national dominance and the "Great Hashrate Migration" begins anew, proving dominance is, and always has been, ephemeral.  
The evidence of national dominance in cryptocurrency mining is clear, present, and sequential. The critical takeaway for any stakeholder is that the *nature* of this dominance has evolved. The network's resilience is no longer a simple question of geographic distribution; it is a complex, technical-political battle over protocol-level control. The network's defense has shifted from *geography* (fleeing China) to *protocol* (adopting Stratum v2).
